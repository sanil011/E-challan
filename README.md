# E-Challan

# Problem
Currently only 30-35% of all e-challans generated for traffic are being paid by the errant public. Can this be improved through a digital solution. The police issuse several lakh challan everyday still due to staff limitation they issue only a few thousand challans each day. This results in non-issuance of challan and thus in revenue loss, since older challans can always be disputed. Therefore, currently only 30% citizens actually end up paying challans that are issued to them. Is there a way to digitally improve challan generation and collection instead the city police? Better e-challan collection.

# Solution

## -> E-Challan Generation
Constable only have to upload picture and offence to generation e-challan on the vehicle number.
Our application will extract infomation of the vehicle through image of number plate and add new challan to the database.

## -> E-Challan Collection
We will offer multiple schemes to lure offencer in settling their challan early as possible.
Schemes like 10% off under 10 days of settlement.
Failure to pay thier due in time will have consequences like Driver Licence suspension, seizing the vehicle, or a constable will visit at the registered address to collect the challan.
